Yes, the inventory data can be updated based on the predictions made by the model. Here's how it can work:

Prediction by the Model: The model predicts the demand for each product for the upcoming week based on historical sales data, external factors like weather conditions, holidays, and weekdays.

Update Inventory: Once the predictions are obtained, they can be used to estimate the quantity of each product that will be sold in the upcoming week. This estimated demand can then be subtracted from the current inventory to determine how much stock needs to be replenished.

Stock Replenishment: The inventory can be replenished by ordering new stock to meet the predicted demand. The quantity to be ordered can be calculated by subtracting the current inventory from the predicted demand.

Updating Inventory Data: After the new stock is received and added to the inventory, the inventory data can be updated accordingly. The quantity in stock for each product and the date of stock can be modified to reflect the new stock levels.

Repeat Process: This process can be repeated on a weekly basis, with the model making predictions for each week and the inventory being updated accordingly.
